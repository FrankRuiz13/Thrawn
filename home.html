            <blockquote><b>Mitth'raw'nuruodo</b>, more commonly known as Thrawn, was a Chiss male officer and Grand Admiral of
                the
                Imperial
                Navy during the reign of the Galactic Empire. An alien Imperial officer with striking blue skin, red
                eyes,
                and an angular face, Thrawn was well known as a brilliant and ruthless strategist. He believed that in
                order
                to achieve victory in war, one must know their enemy. As such, he dedicated himself to understanding the
                philosophy, art, and culture of his opponents, which included the Twi'leks of Ryloth and the warriors of
                Mandalore. When Governor Arihnda Pryce requested a strong commander capable of defeating the rebels on
                Lothal, Grand Admiral Thrawn accepted the challenge, intending to dismantle the rebellion one piece at a
                time.</blockquote>

            <blockquote>Before joining the Imperial Military, Thrawn served with the Defense Fleet of the Chiss
                Ascendancy.
                A native of the planet Csilla, located in the Unknown Regions of the galaxy, Thrawn left his homeworld
                and
                traveled to known space where he encountered the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker during the Clone Wars.
                Following the Galactic Republic's reorganization into the Galactic Empire, Thrawn offered his allegiance
                to
                Emperor Palpatine, having deemed an alliance with the new regime beneficial to his people. With the help
                of
                Cadet Eli Vanto, Thrawn assimilated into galactic society, becoming fluent in Galactic Basic and
                ultimately
                graduating from the Royal Imperial Academy on Coruscant. His career in the Navy was notably successful;
                after a series of promotions, he received the rank of Grand Admiral from the Emperor himself.
